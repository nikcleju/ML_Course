# Objective

Students should understand and be able use some basic pretrained CNN models available in Matlab

# Contents

## CNN networks 

CNNs are multilayer networks adapted for image processing, which use the **convolution** operation extensively.

### Starting points

1. The layers in a normal multilayer perceptron network (MLP) are **fully-connected**: each output value is a combination of all inputs 
2. Each full-connected layer is a **full (dense) matrix**

Problems: 

1. Images are large: 1 Mexapixel color image = 3 million values
2. Fully-connected layers have **huge** size (the number of parameters in fully-connected layers is huge).

**Example** Consider a layer with input size =  300 x 300 color pixels, and output size equivalent to 150 x 150 color pixels. 
How many parameters does this layer have?


### Convolution

DSP deja-vu vibes: $$y[n] = \sum_k x[n-k] h[k]$$

- Some videos here: a **kernel** with fixed coefficients $h[k]$ is slided over the input $x[n]$ and computes the output as a linear combination of the surrounding input samples

Key points:

- Convolution has been used since ever in signal and image processing for **extracting features** (edges, frequency bands, etc)

- Convolution is a kind of matrix multiplication, with an almost sparse matrix of a special form ("circulant" or "Toeplitz")

- Each output value depends only on the surrounding pixels

### Convolutional Neural Networks

- The basic unit is now **a layer**

- The data is viewed as **tensors**: 3D cubes of data (like a three-dimensional matrix)

- Each layer takes as input an $M_1 \times N_1 \times C_1$ tensor and produces an output $M_2 \times N_2 \times C_2$ tensor

- We don't think of individual neurons anymore. Each neuron in a convolutional layer does exactly the same operation as the others, with the same weights, but "sees" just one small part of the input image

### Architecture of a CNN

**AlexNet:**

[1] Krizhevsky, Alex; Sutskever, Ilya; Hinton, Geoffrey E. (2017-05-24). "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks" (PDF). Communications of the ACM. 60 (6): 84–90. doi:10.1145/3065386. ISSN 0001-0782.

### Layer types

Open the AlexNet model in Matlab and look at the architecture directly

```matlab
net = alexnet('Weights','imagenet')
analyzeNetwork(net)  % or double-click `net` in the Workspace
```

Layer types:

- Convolutional
- Activation
- Pooling (MaxPooling)
- Fully connected (e.g. like in multilayer perceptron)
- Softmax activation to get probability-like scores (like in multilayer perceptron)
- Other optional stuff: normalization, dropout, batch normalization etc

A CNN can be viewed as a feature extractor + classificator:
 
- The output layers are very similar to multilayer perceptron: fully-connected layers + softmax
- The first part, with the convolution layers, is a kind of **feature extractor**

### The model

A CNN has a fixed arcihtecture composed of several layers. For typical networks, the architecture is described in the accompanying papers.

**Inputs**: 

   - a color image represented as a tensor $X$ of size $L_1 \times L_2 \times 3$
 
**Outputs** (assuming one-hot encoding):
 
  - a vector $\hat{y}$ which should be understood as scores/probability of belonging in each class
  - the **location of the maximum** value gives the predicted class
  

### The model parameters

The model parameters are the parameters of the layers:

 - the filter coefficients in the convolutional layers
 
 - the weights in the fully-connected layers
 
 The number of parameters of the convolutional layers is **much smaller** than for fully-connected layers.

### The cost function

For classification, the **cross-entropy** is typically used. This is exactly similar to how it is used in MLP networks.

For a single input:

$$L(y, \hat{y}) = - y_1 \log{\hat{y_1}} - \dots - y_n \log{\hat{y_n}} = -\log{\hat{y_{class}}},$$

where $\hat{y_{class}}$ is the model's predicted probability for the true class of the input.

For multiple inputs: do the average of all
$$J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i L(y^i, \hat{y}^i)$$

### Training

Training is done with **backpropagation** and gradient descent (or some variant of it).

**Backpropagation** = the technique to compute the derivatives of $J$  with respect to all parameters in the network.

Same story as for multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks

## Matlab tools and functions for working with CNNs

There are lots of new functions and tools in Matlab for deep neural networks, since the last 2-3 years. There are also Matlab courses and tutorials on how to use them.

But whoever is serious on this subject should use the Python frameworks (Pytorch, Tensorflow/Keras).

### Deep Network Designer

### Other frameworks besides Matlab

The most used deep learning frameworks are written in Python:

- Tersorflow + Keras
- Pytorch
- ...

# Practical work

## Exercise 1 - Play with pretrained networks

1. Load the AlexNet model with pretrained weights on the ImageNet database. Open the model and examine the architecure.

   - How many parameters does the first convolutional layer have?
   - How many parameters does each trainable layer have? (trainable = convolutional or fully-connected)
   - What is the share of the fully-connected layers in the total number of parameters?

2. Compare other networks (GoogLeNet, Resnet-18, Mobile-net v2) with AlexNet:

   - which has more/less layers?
   - which has bigger/smaller fully-connected layers at the end?

1. Play with GoogLeNet/AlexNet. Download an image of a dog from the Internet and classify it. Does it work?

   The ImageNet class names can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a)

2. For the used image, visualize the internal activations of the layers 'conv1', 'conv2', 'fc7' and 'prob' inside the network. What are their shape?

   Use the following code sample:

   ```matlab
   act1 = activations(net,im,'conv1');
   
   % Nice plotting
   sz = size(act1);
   act1 = reshape(act1,[sz(1) sz(2) 1 sz(3)]);
   I = imtile(mat2gray(act1),'GridSize',[8 8]);
   imshow(I)
   ```

   The sample code is taken from here: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/visualize-activations-of-a-convolutional-neural-network.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/visualize-activations-of-a-convolutional-neural-network.html)
  
## Exercise 2 - Transfer Learning to classify Cola vs Pepsi

Use transfer learning to train AlexNet (or GoogLeNet) to classify images of Pepsi vs CocaCola beverages.

The dataset is in the file `Data_PepsiCola.zip,` downloaded from here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/pepsi-and-cocacola-images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/pepsi-and-cocacola-images)

1. Download and unzip images, look through them
2. Use the training data to train the network
3. Test the results with some of the images from the dataset.

## Exercise 3 - Add a new layer and retrain

1. In DeepNetworkDesigner, and remove one convolutional layer (+ the pooling layer after it) from the middle part of AlexNet.
   Retrain the whole network on the Pepsi/Cola dataset (it may take some time).

2. Add one extra convolutional layer (+ pooling) in the middle part of AlexNet.
   Retrain the whole network on the Pepsi/Cola dataset (it may take some time).
