## Description

For the last weeks of the semester, you will have to implement a mini-project.

The task of the project is to **do a classification and/or regression task on a dataset, using one of the usual machine learning algorithms**.

Examples:

- image classification with CNN networks
- classification or prediction on other data, using MLP networks or logistic regression
- any other idea, with any other algorithm you may know or want to use

A list of datasets to choose from is provided at the end of this file.

You can use Matlab or other programming languages you may know (e.g. Python).

### Deliverables

The project should be finalized with a **written report**, consisting of a few pages, which should discuss:

- The dataset used
  - What sort of data it contains
  - Examples of the images from each class
  - Is the dataset balanced or unbalanced (roughly same amount of data in each category, or not)
  - Anything else of interest
- What is desired to obtain
- What algorithm is used, and how you used it (parameter values etc.)
- Results: include classification results, training results (if relevant), any other graphical or numerical result relevant for the problem
- Any personal comments or conclusions

The project must be presented in 5-10 minutes presentation, either in the last week project sessions or on some agreed date before the exam.

### Tips'n Tricks and other instructions

- If the dataset is too large, you can use only a smaller part of it (i.e. classify between 2 or 3 classes instead of 100)

- Images can be resampled to a desired resolution (e.g. 224 x 224 for AlexNet)

- Small MNIST like images (28x28) can be used with MLP networks. The images can also be resized to larger values such for CNNs to be used (e.g. 224 x 224 for AlexNet)

- This list contains only **suggested** datasets and tasks. You can use a custom dataset (for safety, check with me first). The only requirement is that it is interesting.
